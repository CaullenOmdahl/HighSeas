## Gemini CLI One-Shot Usage

The Gemini CLI can be used for quick, one-shot commands without entering an interactive chat session. This is useful for scripting, quick lookups, or integrating Gemini into other workflows.

### Examples

**Asking for definitions:**
```bash
gemini chat "What is a RESTful API?"
```

**Summarizing content:**
```bash
gemini chat "Summarize the key points of the provided text: [paste text here]"
```

**Generating short code snippets:**
```bash
gemini chat "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."
```

**Quick lookups:**
```bash
gemini chat "What is the capital of France?"
```
